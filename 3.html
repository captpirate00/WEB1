    Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems,
    which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application
    software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used in a wide variety of
    computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. Java applets,
    which are less common than standalone Java applications, were commonly run in secure,
    sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications through being embedded in HTML pages.</p>
